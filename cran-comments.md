There is one NOTE on Windows (Server 2022, R-devel 64-bit):

* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'

As noted in R-hub issue #503, this could be due to a bug/crash in MiKTeX and can likely be ignored.




There is one NOTE on Fedora Linux:

* checking HTML version of manual ... NOTE
Skipping checking HTML validation: no command 'tidy' found

Also noted in R-hub issue #548.
